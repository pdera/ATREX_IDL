NAME:
 	inside_detector_circle, pix, marg

 PURPOSE:
	Tell what your routine does here.  I like to start with the words:
	"This function (or procedure) ..."
	Try to use the active, present tense.

 CATEGORY:
	Put a category (or categories) here.  For example:
	Widgets.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	Write the calling sequence here. Include only positional parameters
	(i.e., NO KEYWORDS). For procedures, use the form:

	object->inside_detector_circle(pix, marg)

	Note that the routine name is ALL CAPS and arguments have Initial
	Caps.  For functions, use the form:

	Result = FUNCTION_NAME(Parameter1, Parameter2, Foobar)

	Always use the "Result = " part to begin. This makes it super-obvious
	to the user that this routine is a function!

 INPUTS:
	Parm1:	Describe the positional input parameters here. Note again
		that positional parameters are shown with Initial Caps.

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:
	Parm2:	Describe optional inputs here. If you don't have any, just
		delete this section.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
	KEY1:	Document keyword parameters like this. Note that the keyword
		is shown in ALL CAPS!

	KEY2:	Yet another keyword. Try to use the active, present tense
		when describing your keywords.  For example, if this keyword
		is just a set or unset flag, say something like:
		"Set this keyword to use foobar subfloatation. The default
		 is foobar superfloatation."

 OUTPUTS:
	Describe any outputs here.  For example, "This function returns the
	foobar superflimpt version of the input array."  This is where you
	should also document the return value for functions.

 OPTIONAL OUTPUTS:
	Describe optional outputs here.  If the routine doesn't have any,
	just delete this section.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
	BLOCK1:	Describe any common blocks here. If there are no COMMON
		blocks, just delete this entry.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
	Describe "side effects" here.  There aren't any?  Well, just delete
	this entry.

 RESTRICTIONS:
	Describe any "restrictions" here.  Delete this section if there are
	no important restrictions.

 PROCEDURE:
	You can describe the foobar superfloatation method being used here.
	You might not need this section for your routine.

 EXAMPLE:
	Please provide a simple example here. An example from the
	DIALOG_PICKFILE documentation is shown below. Please try to
	include examples that do not rely on variables or data files
	that are not defined in the example code. Your example should
	execute properly if typed in at the IDL command line with no
	other preparation.

       Create a DIALOG_PICKFILE dialog that lets users select only
       files with the extension `pro'. Use the `Select File to Read'
       title and store the name of the selected file in the variable
       file. Enter:

       file = DIALOG_PICKFILE(/READ, FILTER = '*.pro')

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
 	Written by:	Your name here, Date.
	July, 1994	Any additional mods get described here.  Remember to
			change the stuff above if you add a new keyword or
			something!
